# 🔌 Grid Reliability Analysis Dashboard

**Author**: Janati Nakimera  
**Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel, U.S. EIA Form 861, DOE OE-417, EAGLE-I outage data

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a Tableau dashboard analyzing electric grid reliability in the United States using real-world data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), DOE Major Disturbance Reports (OE-417), and county-level outage records from EAGLE-I. The goal is to visualize and interpret reliability trends through key industry-standard metrics (SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI), spatial outage patterns, and the relationship between load and outage frequency.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Reliability Metrics Overview**: Interactive KPI cards showing annual SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI values.
- **Trends Over Time**: Line charts tracking reliability indices from 2018–2022.
- **Outage Map** *(Optional)*: Geographic visualization using latitude and longitude.
- **Cause Analysis** *(if added)*: Breakdown of outages by type such as weather, equipment failure, etc.
- **Executive Insights**: Commentary and annotations for deeper understanding.
- **Filters**: Drop-down controls for state and year selection.
