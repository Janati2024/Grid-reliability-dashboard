# 🔌 Grid Reliability Analysis Dashboard

**Author**: Janati Nakimera  
**Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel, U.S. EIA Form 861, DOE OE-417, EAGLE-I outage data

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a Tableau dashboard analyzing electric grid reliability in the United States using real-world data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), DOE Major Disturbance Reports (OE-417), and county-level outage records from EAGLE-I. The goal is to visualize and interpret reliability trends through key industry-standard metrics (SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI), spatial outage patterns, and the relationship between load and outage frequency.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Interactive KPI Cards**: Display average SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI and percentage changes over the selected time frame.
- **SAIDI Index Trends**: Line chart comparing SAIDI across states (e.g., MA and TX) from 2018–2022.
- **SAIFI Index Trends**: Line chart showing reliability frequency trends over time.
- **CAIDI Over Time**: Bar chart illustrating average interruption durations year-by-year.
- **Filter Controls**: Custom dropdown filters for year and state to dynamically update visuals.
- **Color-Coded Dashboard**: Distinct styling to highlight key metrics and performance changes.
- **Executive Insight Zones**: KPIs are visually separated for easier stakeholder review and snapshot reporting.
