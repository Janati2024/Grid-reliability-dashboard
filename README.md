# Grid Reliability Analysis Dashboard

**Author:** Janati Nakimera  
**Tools Used:** Tableau, EIA Form 861, DOE OE-417, EAGLE-I Outage Data  

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a Tableau dashboard analyzing electric grid reliability in the United States using real-world data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), DOE Major Disturbance Reports (OE-417), and county-level outage records from EAGLE-I. The goal is to visualize and interpret reliability trends through key industry-standard metrics (SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIDI), spatial outage patterns, and the relationship between load and outage frequency.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Reliability Metrics Overview:** Interactive KPI cards showing annual SAIDI, SAIFI, and CAIDI values.
- **Trends Over Time:** Line charts tracking reliability indices from 2015–2022.
- **Outage Map:** Geographic visualization of county-level outages using color-coded reliability severity.
- **Cause Analysis:** Donut and bar charts breaking down causes of outages (e.g., storms, equipment failure).
- **Executive Insights:** Annotations highlighting major events, improvements, or risks.
- **Filters:** Dropdowns for year, region, and outage type for exploratory analysis.
